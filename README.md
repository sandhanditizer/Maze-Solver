# Maze-Solver
Fun maze solver that uses two different searching algorithms - best-first-search and breadth-first-search.

The build_maze.py file generates a random maze.txt file and then solve_maze.py takes in that generated file and solves the maze using one of the two algorithms. You can then see the path taken in the solved_maze.txt file (best-first-search is faster). You dont need to seperately generate the maze, just run the solve_maze.py file.
